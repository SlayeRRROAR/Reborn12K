The Ash wood can act as the perfect conduit of magic, as it doesn't cause disturbance in the flow of Mana like other types of wood."

It's said that the nine realms are held by the branches of the tree, including Asgard, home of the Gods, while its roots reach deep down into hell. The tree is also the home of Nidhogg, an evil serpent-like dragon."
